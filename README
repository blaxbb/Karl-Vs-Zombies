If you have any problems, please email source@HvZSource.com

What you need:
Webserver
MySQL DB
PHP 5
We have run it on a LAMP system as well as on Lighttpd on Linux.  It should work on other platforms aswell.

Install:
Upload files
Set Permissions (chmod -R 777 pics admin/twitter_conf.txt)
Set Admin Registration Password (in the file settings/config.dat)
Set Database Cradentials (in the file settings/config.dat)

All configurations (time zone/ twitter/ edit rules / front page/ edit players) take place in the admin section (ex. http://yoursite.com/admin).  

Known Bugs and Issues:
-Need pagination in player list 
-If you edit the system generated original zombie character, it sets the character as human?  weird bug...  just don't mess with that user... EVER!
When an administrator tries to edit a user picture, they get this error: Warning: move_uploaded_file(pics/Max_.jpg) [function.move-uploaded-file]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /home5/humansvs/public_html/games/truman/admin/edit_player.php on line 63 Warning: move_uploaded_file() [function.move-uploaded-file]: Unable to move '/var/tmp/phpkjwcc8' to 'pics/Max_.jpg' in /home5/humansvs/public_html/games/truman/admin/edit_player.php on line 63
